# Project Statement – Bus Booking System

## Problem Statement
In many small bus services the ticket booking is still done on paper or by writing names in a notebook. 
It becomes confusing when seats get filled or when someone wants to cancel a ticket. So I decided to make 
a small system where the user can book a ticket on the computer and store the details properly.

## Scope of the Project
The project mainly focuses on basic ticket booking activities like adding a new booking, checking the 
existing bookings and cancelling a booking. It doesn’t include online payments or database connection. 
It uses simple text files to keep the tickets saved.

## Target Users
This kind of system can be useful for:
- Small travel agencies
- Local bus operators
- Students learning Java GUI and file handling

## High-level Features
- Login page for accessing the system
- Ticket booking form with name, bus number, seats, date etc.
- View all booked tickets
- Cancel tickets using ticket ID
- Stores details in text files
