# Bus Booking System – Java Project

This is a small desktop application I made for my flipped course project. 
The idea was to build something simple where a user can book a bus ticket, 
check the booked tickets, and cancel them if needed. I used basic Core Java 
and Swing because we were asked to use the concepts taught in class.

## What the project does
- Login page (just a basic username and password)
- Book a ticket by entering name, bus number, seats, date etc.
- View all the tickets that were saved
- Cancel a ticket using the ticket ID
- Tickets are saved as text files on the system

## Why I chose this
I wanted to make something simple but useful, and I thought a bus ticket 
booking idea would be easy to implement using Swing and file handling.

## Technologies I used
- Java (JDK)
- Swing for the interface
- File Handling for saving tickets
- HashMap for storing booked seat count temporarily

## How to run it
1. Install Java JDK if not already installed.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code (or any editor).
3. Compile the file using:
   javac AdvancedBusBookingSystem.java
4. Then run it using:
   java AdvancedBusBookingSystem

It should open a window where the login page appears first.

## Notes
This is not a full-scale booking system. It's only for learning purposes.  
I kept the code simple so I can understand and explain it during evaluation.
